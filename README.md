Hi, I'm Ansel! I'm a full-stack developer with recent experience at a workforce management company, where I built scheduling and real-time communication tools to streamline shift coordination. I come from a background in project management and real estate development, which sparked my interest in data visualization and web development. My formal training is in quantitative finance and music technology.
