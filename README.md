Hi, I'm Ansel! I'm a full-stack developer currently building AI agent systems using Python and PydanticAI. I work with structured AI workflows and conversational interfaces that automate complex business processes through intelligent agent orchestration, with a strong emphasis on evaluation frameworks and observability to ensure reliable AI performance.

Previously, I worked at a workforce management company, where I built scheduling and real-time communication tools to streamline shift coordination. I come from a background in project management and real estate development, which sparked my interest in data visualization and web development. My formal training is in quantitative finance and music technology.
